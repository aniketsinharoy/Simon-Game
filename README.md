# Simon-Game
<p>The game consists of a device with four colored buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow. The device also has a built-in speaker that produces corresponding tones for each color. The game's main objective is to follow the sequence of colors and sounds generated by the device. The device begins by illuminating and playing a sound for one of the colors. The player must then repeat the same sequence by pressing the buttons in the correct order. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer and more complex, requiring players to remember and reproduce longer sequences accurately.</p>
